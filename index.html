<h1>Projects and Examples</h1>

<p>Welcome and thank you for taking the time to look at my portfolio.</p>

<p>Please find below a list of Projects / Examples that I have developed over my career.</p>

<p>As a result of sanatising some of the data held within the code e.g. usernames, passwords etc...
some of these Projects / Examples may need minor adjustments in order to get them working correctly.</p>

<p>If you have any questions then please do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:julianmummery@gmail.com" target="_blank">contact me</a>.</p>
