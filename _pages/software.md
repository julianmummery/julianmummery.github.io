<h2>Entity Image Uploader (for Sage CRM)</h2>
<p style="font-size:0.80em; margin-top:0;">Entity Image Uploader takes the pain out implementing new images for any Sage CRM Entity. It will convert and install the correct size image with the appropriate file type and save it in all the theme locations within the Sage CRM application directory structure.</p>
<p style="font-size:0.80em; margin-top:0;">Please feel free to download and install onto the Sage CRM Server.<br><a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!At3810Vk-70NgU3xinJIc_Y4BJM-?e=IeqxAM" target="_blank">Download Setup</a> | <a href="https://youtu.be/W9DZOO-T2do" target="_blank">Video Demonstration</a></p>

<h2>Secure Privacy (Native Android App)</h2>
<p style="font-size:0.80em; margin-top:0;">Native Android App that directly interfaces with a customised Netgear Nighthawk R7000 router that is configured to use NordVPN as a VPN service. The purpose of this app was to create an easy way of changing the VPN's server country location without having to login to the router via a browser and make all the configuration changes that would be necessary to achieve the same result.</p>
<p style="font-size:0.80em; margin-top:0;">Please feel free to download and install the APK onto your Android Device after all pre-requisites are met.<br><a href="https://julianmummery.github.io/secureprivacy/#1" target="_blank">Prerequisites</a> | <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!At3810Vk-70NgU3xinJIc_Y4BJM-?e=IeqxAM" target="_blank">Download Android APK</a> | <a href="https://youtu.be/W9DZOO-T2do" target="_blank">Secure Privacy Video Demo</a></p>
