<h2>JAVA (Native Android Apps)</h2>
<h5 style="padding-left:1em;">Secure Privacy</h5>
<ul style="font-size:0.80em;">
  <li>This app was developed to directly interface with a hardened Netgear Nighthawk router running DD-WRT. The Nighthawk router was setup with specific settings to allow connection via NordVPN's vast array of secure servers. The app allowed connection to the router and enabled easily changing the country/ip address dynamically. Other features were also added like the ability to restart the router or download and apply to the router the latest NordVPN Secure Server List. All servers are categorised by country and will be displayed in server load percentage ascending order. Choose your country and server and then apply the changes directly onto the router. All connected devices will then be automatically re-routed.

<h5 style="padding-left:1em;">Engineer Checkin and Reporting</h5>
<ul style="font-size:0.80em;">
  <li>This app was developed to allow engineer's to check-in to their jobs and access reports and documents that can be synchronised with a backend SQL Server database whilst on the job. The back office system (Sage CRM) is then used to access these records. Uploaded signatures and photos can also be synchronised with the back office system to acknowledge a completed job by the engineer. Utilising the Sage SData2.0 API to transfer data both ways. The data stored on the device is stored locally in an SQLite database.
