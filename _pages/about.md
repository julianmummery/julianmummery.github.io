<h2>Bio / Profile</h2>
<p style="font-size:0.80em; margin-top:0;">I have a keen passion for technology, especially programming since a very young age.</p>
<p style="font-size:0.80em; margin-top:0;">Programming all started for me when I taught myself AMOS on the Amiga and then progressed to creating amateur games on the ZX Spectrum 48k and the BBC Model B during the mid-eighties.</p>
<p style="font-size:0.80em; margin-top:0;">During 1990 I got my first opportunity to be part of a computer help desk team looking after around four hundren staff. This soon progressed to a Mainframe Computer Operator role working twelve hour shifts and which involved monitoring the overnight batch jobs which in-turn produced scheduled departmental reports.</p>
<p style="font-size:0.80em; margin-top:0;">Commercial programming started for me during 1992 when I was trained as a Mainframe COBOL programmer. After several years the business moved to Open SYstems and this gave me the opportunity to cross-train into Microfocus COBOL (GUI) and Microfocus 4GL (Batch) programming.</p>
<p style="font-size:0.80em; margin-top:0;">Not long after the .NET Framework 1.1 was made available by Microsoft back in April 2003 I was again cross-trained to use ASP.NET / VB.NET which we used to create various Web Applications / Customer Portals and Internal Systems.</p>
<p style="font-size:0.80em; margin-top:0;">This was just the beginning for me and along the way I have acquired numerous skills working in I.T.</p>
