<p>I have a keen passion for technology, especially programming since a very young age.</p>
<p>Programming all started for me when I taught myself AMOS on the Amiga and then progressed to creating amateur games on the ZX Spectrum 48k and the BBC Model B during the mid-eighties.</p>
<p>During 1990 I got my first opportunity to be part of a computer help desk team looking after around four hundren staff. This soon progressed to a Mainframe Computer Operator role working twelve hour shifts and which involved monitoring the overnight batch jobs which in-turn produced scheduled departmental reports.</p>
<p>Commercial programming started for me during 1992 when I was trained as a Mainframe COBOL programmer. After several years the business moved to Open SYstems and this gave me the opportunity to cross-train into Microfocus COBOL (GUI) and Microfocus 4GL (Batch) programming.</p>
<p>As soon as .NET was made available by Microsoft I was again cross-trained to use VB.NET & ASP.NET which we used to create various Customer Portals and internal systems.</p>
<p>This was just the beginning for me and along the way I have acquired numerous skills working in I.T.</p>
